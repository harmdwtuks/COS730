<h3>Introcucing myself</h3>

Hi, I am Harm de Wet (u20798441) a part-time Hons. Computer Science student at the University of Pretoria. I am furthuring my studies to acieve my goal of being a data scientist and software engineer knowing multiple sides of the industry with the hopes to own my own Software Developmemt House.

I currently work as a senior developer for a digital forensics and analytics company working on the core products of the company. I am given a lot of free roam at the compay to advance the systems in any sensible manner I deem fit.

The art of digital forensics was one of the most fascinating fields until I discovered data science and software engineering, now I am in 3 minds and need to find a way to combine all of these sub-fields into one.

My main interest is software development (mainly the back-end), neural networks, videography and photography in my spare time.

My main skill set includes (but not limited to)
  Software development 
    ASP.NET (Full Stack)
    C++
    SQL (MSSQL)
    Neural networks
  Software project management
